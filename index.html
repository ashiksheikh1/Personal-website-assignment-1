            <p>Hurricanes are windstorms accompanied by heavy rain storms
                Wind blows at least 74 miles per hour!
                Hurricanes can appear in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.
                Hurricanes rotate counter-clockwise around an “eye”

            <p>Hurricanes happen when warm sea water interacts with warm air above it.
                Differences in pressure cause water evaporating off of the ocean to spiral into a tornado shape.
                The eye of the hurricane is where the air is warmest.
                The water releases energy, which causes more water to evaporate, which increase the amount of rain</p>

            <p>Warm air and water are the causes of hurricanes.
                Increasing air and water temperatures from global warming may increase the chances of a hurricane
                forming.
                By working on reducing pollution around the world, we can possibly lower air and water temperatures.</p>
